# üì¶ Demand Forecasting System

A Machine Learning application that predicts **weekly product sales** based on **store type**, **product family**, and **promotion status** using **XGBoost** and **time series features**. The goal is to help businesses forecast product demand a week ahead to improve inventory planning and reduce stockouts or overstocking.

Built with a full pipeline: from raw data to a real-time interactive app using **Streamlit**.
